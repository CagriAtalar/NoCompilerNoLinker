# NoCompilerNoLinker
No compiler No Linker, Automatic Executer

This code automatically creates ELF Header in the file ,which is executable file format in Linux, and creates assembly code byte format and put it into text section. then it is a elf format file. 

First:  
```bash
gcc -o Makelf makelf.c
```

Then run the code
```bash
./Makelf
```
Now it creates **(tiny_hello)** file.

then lets make our file executable:  
```bash
chmod +x tiny_hello
```

now it is executable ðŸŽ‰

and finally:  
```bash
./tiny_hello
```

ta daaaa :D it printed **Hi** on the screen :D without any compilers any linkers any preprocessors :D
